[![Build Status (Travis)](https://travis-ci.org/mfaltys/doic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mfaltys/doic)  
Doic is a DNS based indicator of compromise (IOC) written in go.  This tool is designed to be a very low

personal use.  If you want to track our day-to-day activities, check out our
